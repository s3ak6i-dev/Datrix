## Try It — Sample Dataset & Model

Three files in [`sample_data/`](sample_data/) let you test Datrix end-to-end and run inference immediately:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`customer_churn_demo.csv`](sample_data/customer_churn_demo.csv) | 315-row SaaS churn dataset with embedded quality issues |
| [`churn_model.joblib`](sample_data/churn_model.joblib) | Pre-trained RandomForest churn predictor (scikit-learn pipeline) |
| [`churn_model_metadata.json`](sample_data/churn_model_metadata.json) | Model card — features, metrics, class distribution |
| [`predict.py`](sample_data/predict.py) | Inference script — batch predictions or interactive single-customer mode |

### Dataset — what Datrix detects

The CSV has intentional quality issues across all five Quality Engine dimensions:

| Issue | Column | Severity | What Datrix catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.9% null values | `age` | ⚠️ Warning | Completeness — null rate |
| 1.9% null values | `nps_score` | ℹ️ Info | Completeness — null rate |
| 1.9% null labels | `churned` | ⚠️ Warning | Label quality — null labels |
| 15 duplicate rows | — | ⚠️ Warning | Consistency — exact duplicate rows |
| Spend outliers (>$3,500) | `monthly_spend` | ℹ️ Info | Accuracy — IQR 3× fence |
| Mixed case | `region`, `plan_type` | ℹ️ Info | Consistency — format inconsistency |
| Log-normal skew | `monthly_spend` | ℹ️ Info | Distribution — high skewness |
| 5:1 class imbalance | `churned` | ⚠️ Warning | Label quality — class imbalance |

### Model — quick start

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas joblib

# Batch predictions on the demo CSV (saves *_predictions.csv)
python sample_data/predict.py

# Run on your own CSV
python sample_data/predict.py --file path/to/your_data.csv

# Interactive single-customer prediction
python sample_data/predict.py --single
```

Model card:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Algorithm** | RandomForestClassifier (200 trees, balanced class weights) |
| **Target** | `churned` — binary yes/no |
| **Features** | age, tenure, spend, tickets, last login, NPS, region, plan |
| **Accuracy** | 80.6% |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.577 (on messy raw data — by design) |
| **Top predictors** | tenure\_months, monthly\_spend, nps\_score, age |

> The modest AUC on the raw file is intentional — it demonstrates the data quality → model performance link. Upload to Datrix, fix the issues with the Cleaning Wizard, retrain, and watch the score improve.

### Testing it in Datrix

1. Go to [datrix-test.vercel.app](https://datrix-test.vercel.app) and register
2. **Datasets → Upload** `customer_churn_demo.csv`
3. The Quality Engine scans automatically — ranked issues appear within seconds
4. Use the **Cleaning Wizard** to fix nulls and drop duplicates, then re-scan to watch the score climb
5. Head to **Benchmark** to train your own model and compare against the pre-trained one

| Role | What Datrix gives you |
|---|---|
| **Data scientists** | Upload → scan → clean → benchmark, all in one UI with no code |
| **ML engineers** | Reusable pipeline sequences, active learning, trained model exports |
| **Data engineers** | Lineage DAG, PII scanner, compliance reports, audit log |
| **Teams** | Shared Marketplace + Workspaces for collaborative data projects |

---

## Modules

### 🏠 Home Dashboard

The default landing page after login. Shows a personalized greeting, real-time workspace stats, quick-action cards tailored to your use cases, and the three most recent datasets and pipelines — all with live data.

- **Onboarding wizard** — 3-step full-screen wizard on first login (name → role → use cases) that personalises the dashboard
- **Getting started checklist** — disappears automatically once you've uploaded a dataset and created a pipeline
- **Quick actions** — dynamically chosen from your selected use cases (falls back to clean / pipeline / synthetic)
- **Recent activity** — last 3 datasets and pipelines with status badges and relative timestamps, clickable to their detail pages

---

### 📦 Datasets

Upload CSV / JSON / JSONL / Parquet / Excel and get instant quality intelligence. Every dataset is profiled on upload and scored across five weighted dimensions.

**Upload & Ingestion**
- Drag-and-drop or button upload with a live XHR progress bar (real byte tracking, not simulated)
- Supported formats: CSV, JSON, JSONL, Parquet, XLS, XLSX — max size configurable
- Automatic schema detection: `Int64`, `Float64`, `Utf8`, `Boolean`, `Date` column types via Polars
- Status lifecycle with 2-second auto-polling: `pending → ingesting → scanning → ready → error`

**Quality Scoring**
- Five-dimension weighted score (0–100):

  | Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
  |---|---|---|
  | Completeness | 25% | Null rates across all columns |
  | Consistency | 25% | Type mismatches, format violations |
  | Accuracy | 25% | Outliers, impossible values |
  | Distribution | 15% | Skew, kurtosis, class imbalance |
  | Label Quality | 10% | Target column validity and balance |

- Every issue ranked by severity: `critical` → `warning` → `info`
- Scan history stored with timestamp and score delta — track improvement over time

**Column Explorer**
- Per-column: inferred type, null rate bar, unique count, sample values
- Distribution charts: histogram for numerics, bar chart for categoricals
- Full descriptive stats: min, max, mean, std, p25, p50, p75

**Cleaning Wizard**
- 7 fix types: `fill_nulls`, `drop_duplicates`, `clip_outliers`, `cast_type`
- **Preview before applying** — see a before/after sample on affected rows, nothing written until confirmed
- **Per-fix rollback** — every fix snapshots the prior file state; roll back any individual fix independently

---

### 🔀 Pipelines

Build reusable transformation sequences visually. Run them on any compatible dataset. Outputs are downloadable files.

10 step types: `filter`, `select`, `drop`, `rename`, `fill_nulls`, `deduplicate`, `normalize`, `encode_categorical`, `sort`, `lowercase`

- All steps chain as Polars `LazyFrame` operations — nothing materializes until the final `.collect()`
- **Dry-run**: execute in memory, return a 20-row preview, write nothing to disk
- **Full run**: execute and write output as CSV / Parquet / JSON

---

### ✨ Synthetic Data

Generate statistically faithful artificial datasets that mirror your originals without containing any real records.

| Method | Algorithm | Speed | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `statistical` | Per-column distribution fitting | < 5s | Quick augmentation |
| `ctgan` | Conditional Tabular GAN | 5–15 min | Complex correlations |
| `tvae` | Tabular Variational Autoencoder | 5–15 min | Avoiding GAN mode collapse |

---

### 🧠 Active Learning

Train models with as few human labels as possible. The model directs you to the most informative unlabeled examples each round.

6 sampling strategies: `random`, `least_confidence`, `margin`, `entropy`, `coreset`, `committee`

---

### 📊 Benchmark

Side-by-side ML model comparison under identical conditions. Every candidate trains on exactly the same data split with the same evaluation protocol.

4 evaluation protocols · 3 hyperparameter presets · parallel execution · ranked leaderboard · confusion matrices · feature importances

---

### 🛡️ Compliance Autopilot

Automatic data governance — PII detection, lineage tracking, policy enforcement, anonymization, audit logging, and regulatory reports.

- **PII Scanner**: 2-pass detection (50+ column-name signals + 11 regex patterns), 6 risk levels
- **Data Lineage DAG**: auto-built from table relationships, interactive pan/zoom
- **Policy Engine**: 8 built-in policies + custom policy creation
- **Anonymization Wizard**: 7 methods per column
- **Audit Log**: append-only, CSV export, 10,000 event cap
- **Regulatory Reports**: GDPR Article 30, CCPA, HIPAA, General Summary (HTML + JSON)

---

### 🛒 Marketplace

Shared catalogue of datasets, pipelines, ML models, and benchmark configs — entirely local. 15 sample assets seeded on first startup.

- Full-text search, category filter, sort by downloads / rating / newest
- One-click deep copy install — deleting source never affects your installed copy
- 1–5 star ratings + reviews

---

### 👥 Workspaces

Collaborate with teammates on shared datasets and pipelines with a full role-based approval system.

**Membership**
- Create workspaces with a unique slug; invite members by **email** or a shareable **invite link** (7-day expiry, one-click disable)
- Joining via link presents a color-picker so the new member picks their identity color before they land
- Three roles: **Owner** · **Reviewer** · **Member**

**Member identity**
- Every member picks a color from a 12-color palette (stored on their profile)
- Color appears on change-request cards, the home activity feed, and the notification bell — so you can tell at a glance who submitted what

---

### ✅ Change Requests & Approval Workflows

A lightweight governance layer that prevents unreviewed changes from reaching shared data.

**Submitting**
- Any workspace member can open a change request from the `/changes` page
- Fields: title, description, action type (dataset upload, delete, pipeline run, config change, or custom), and **impact level** (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Low-impact requests **auto-approve after 24 hours** if no reviewer acts first

**Review — Kanban board (owners + reviewers)**
- Owners and reviewers see a **4-column Kanban** (one per impact level) for all pending requests
- Members see a flat list of their own submissions
- A red badge on the **Changes** sidebar link shows the current pending count for reviewers and owners

**Role permissions**

| Action | Owner | Reviewer | Member |
|---|---|---|---|
| Submit request | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Approve / reject Low + Medium | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Approve / reject High + Critical | ✅ | — | — |
| Roll back any approval | ✅ | Own approvals only | — |
| Resubmit rejected / rolled-back | ✅ | ✅ | Own only |

**Approval & rejection comments**
- Both approve and reject actions include an **optional comment** field
- The comment is shown on the card and included in the submitter's notification

**Rollback**
- Approved and auto-approved CRs can be rolled back with a reason
- The submitter is notified immediately and can edit and resubmit
- Status trail: `pending → approved → rolled_back → pending` (full history preserved)

**Notifications**
- Clicking a workspace notification jumps directly to the specific card (`/changes?org=X&cr=Y`) and highlights it with a pulse animation
- Notification bell has two sections: **Workspace** (CR events) and **Jobs** (async background jobs)

## Auth & Identity

Datrix ships a complete authentication and identity system:

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Email / password** | Register + login with bcrypt-hashed passwords |
| **Google OAuth** | Sign in with Google (full OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow) |
| **GitHub OAuth** | Sign in with GitHub |
| **JWT tokens** | Access token (30 min) + refresh token (7 days) with rotation on use |
| **Email verification** | Verification email sent on register; resend available from profile |
| **Password reset** | Forgot password → email link → set new password (1-hour expiring tokens) |
| **Per-user data isolation** | Every dataset, pipeline, and job is scoped to the owning user |
| **Profile page** | Edit name, role, company, use cases, avatar URL; change password |
| **Onboarding wizard** | 3-step wizard on first login — name, role, use cases |
| **Notifications** | In-app bell with two sections — **Workspace** (change request events with member color dots) and **Jobs** (async job completion/failure). Polls every 15s; state persisted to `localStorage` so seen CRs don't re-notify on refresh. Clicking a workspace notification navigates to the exact CR card. |
| **Mobile responsive** | Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on screens ≤ 768px |

### Email (dev mode vs production)

Without SMTP configured, all emails (verification links, password reset links) are printed to the **backend terminal** — useful for local development. Set `SMTP_HOST` in `.env` to switch to real sending.

Recommended provider: [Resend](https://resend.com) (3,000 emails/month free).

```bash
# Resend SMTP settings
SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=resend
SMTP_PASSWORD=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Local Dev (2 terminals)

**1. Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s3ak6i-dev/Datrix.git
cd Datrix
```

**2. Backend**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env
```

```bash
python run.py          # runs migrations, then starts on :8000
python run.py --reload # with hot-reload
```

**3. Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**, register an account, and the onboarding wizard launches automatically. After completing it you land on the `/home` dashboard.

On first startup the backend:
1. Runs Alembic migrations (idempotent)
2. Seeds the Marketplace with 15 sample assets
3. Seeds 8 default Compliance policies

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` from `.env.example`.

```bash
# ── Database ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```

Frontend (`frontend/.env`):

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Object Storage

By default Datrix writes uploaded files to `data/uploads/` on the local filesystem. Switch to `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` for any S3-compatible provider (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO) — no application code changes required.

### Cloudflare R2 quick-start

1. Create a bucket `datrix-uploads` in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. **R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens → Create token** — Object Read & Write
3. Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
4. Add to `backend/.env`:

```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
AWS_S3_BUCKET=datrix-uploads
AWS_REGION=auto
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
```

---

## Backups

```bash
bash scripts/backup.sh                 # saves to ./backups/
KEEP_DAYS=30 bash scripts/backup.sh   # retain 30 days
```

Cron example (daily at 2 AM):

```bash
0 2 * * * cd /opt/datrix && bash scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/datrix-backup.log 2>&1
```

---

## Database & Migrations

30 SQLAlchemy ORM tables. Migrations run automatically at startup (3 attempts with 5-second backoff, falls back to `create_all`).

```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
alembic upgrade head
alembic downgrade -1
alembic current
```

**Neon note**: Use the unpooled connection string for Alembic, pooled for the application runtime.

---

## CI / CD

### CI — runs on every push and PR to `main`/`develop`

| Job | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Python 3.12 → `pip install` → Ruff lint → Pyright type-check |
| **Frontend** | Node 20 → `npm ci` → `tsc --noEmit` → `npm run build` |

### Deploy — runs on version tags (`v*`)

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Images pushed to GHCR: `ghcr.io/s3ak6i-dev/datrix-backend:v1.2.0` and `datrix-frontend:v1.2.0`.

---

## Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | JWT access tokens (30 min) + refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation on use |
| **OAuth** | HMAC-SHA256 signed state parameter for CSRF protection on every OAuth flow |
| **Password storage** | bcrypt cost factor 12 — no plaintext ever stored |
| **Password reset** | Single-use tokens, SHA-256 hashed in DB, 1-hour expiry, revokes all sessions on use |
| **Email verification** | Single-use tokens, 24-hour expiry |
| **Per-user isolation** | Every dataset, pipeline, and job filtered by `user_id` — users can only see their own data |
| **Rate limiting** | slowapi — 200 req/min per IP; auth endpoints have stricter limits |
| **CORS** | Configurable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — defaults to localhost only |
| **HTTP headers** | Nginx: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, Permissions-Policy |
| **TLS** | TLSv1.2/1.3 only, ECDHE ciphers, HSTS preload |
| **Input validation** | Pydantic v2 `Field` constraints on every request model; file type + size enforced on upload |
| **SQL injection** | SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries — no raw SQL |

### Before going public

1. Generate a real `SECRET_KEY`: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
2. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
3. Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your exact domain
4. Set `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` to your public domain
5. Never commit `.env` — it is gitignored

---

## Design System

Two themes (dark/light), toggled from the sidebar footer, persisted to `localStorage`, applied before first paint — no flash.

### Token map

```
Surface     bg < bg-2 < bg-3 < bg-card < bg-inset
Text        text-primary > text-secondary > text-tertiary
Accent      --accent (blue) — used sparingly, one per action
Status      --green (success), --warn (warning), --bad (error)
Tints       --blue-tint, --green-dim, --warn-dim, --bad-dim
```

### Typography

| Use | Font | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Headlines | Inter | 300 |
| UI text | Inter | 400 / 500 |
| Labels, numbers, code | IBM Plex Mono | 400 / 500 |

## Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start — `could not connect to server`**
> Your `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` is wrong or the Neon instance is paused. Check the URL and wake the instance from the Neon dashboard.

**`ProactorEventLoop` / `asyncio` error on Windows**
> Always start the backend with `python run.py`, never with bare `uvicorn`.

**CTGAN / TVAE job is very slow**
> Expected — these train a neural network. Expect 5–15 minutes on large datasets. Use `statistical` for quick tests.

**`401 Unauthorized` on all API calls**
> Access token expired. `AuthContext` handles silent refresh automatically. Check `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` is set.

**OAuth redirect fails / "invalid_state" error**
> The `APP_URL` in `.env` must exactly match the redirect URI registered in Google/GitHub. For local dev: `APP_URL=http://localhost:8000`.

**Emails not arriving**
> In dev mode (no `SMTP_HOST` set), emails print to the backend terminal — check there for the link. For production set `SMTP_HOST` and check spam.

**Tour keeps relaunching**
> The tour auto-shows until `datrix-tour-done` is written to `localStorage`. Clears in private/incognito windows — by design.

**`CORS policy` error**
> `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must include the exact frontend origin: `http://localhost:5173` for dev, `https://yourdomain.com` for prod.

**Alembic migration fails on first start**
> If the database is brand new, startup falls back to `create_all` automatically. Check `DATABASE_URL` points to a reachable Postgres instance with `CREATE TABLE` privileges.
